# SpringBootSimpleUser
A simple spring boot crud web application

A web app based on spring boot that provides crud operations on a user information, I used microsoft mssql server as backend- spring boot as backend management, and jsp with bootstrap as front end. I completed again almost the crud operations with ajax. For some messages i used also jstl.

To run the Project install: 1) spring tool suite 4, 
                            2) microsoft sql server & microsoft sql server Management Studio

                            3) create a database with name "demoUsers", password="passw0rd", user="sa"
                            4) extract my project files in the workspace of spring tool suite 4
                            5) Run the project and go to  localhost:8080/homepage or localhost:8080/homepageAjax
