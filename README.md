A simple spring boot crud web application

A web app based on spring boot that provides crud operations on a user information, I used microsoft mssql server as backend- spring boot as backend management, and jsp with bootstrap as front end. I completed again almost the crud operations with ajax. For some messages i used also jstl.

heroku cound not parse jsp include directive so footer - navbar I choose to unfold them
